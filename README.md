This is a repository of my project files and final submission for my final portfolio for the CS-230 Operating Platforms Class at SNHU.

Briefly summarize the Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client desired to expand their already successful game to a cross-platform approach. This would facilitate the need for cross-platform APIs.
and development to take into account implementation for several different operating systems. This expansion from an Android-only game, Draw It or Lose It, to a cross-platform web-based experience will serve as the framework for ensuring connectivity across a multitude of devices. The Gaming Room, as the client sought this expansion to grow their audience while also maintaining cross-connectivity for their established members, the delivery of the product on a web-based platform will facilitate scalability, cross-platform connectivity, and a seamless user experience.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The recommendations section of the design document was particularly well done. This section is comprehensive but concise, so they are easy to understand. Such a format affords these recommendations the ability to easily be applied to real-world applications. In addition, the sections detailing the advantages and weaknesses of each operating system provide a very comprehensive view of which use cases each option is best suited for.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The process of working through a development design document was a very beneficial experience. It offered a unique sense of insight and a renewed sense of focus due to the sequential structure of the document. The ability to quickly revise, or iterate, the document as needed was akin to the routine maintenance and update cycles seen in the implementation stages of programming. The guiding force of the document made the coding and pseudocode aspects of the programming simpler due to the structured and comprehensive brainstorming and planning it provided.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Despite offering a comprehensive overview of the various developmental tools and operating systems, this section was formatted rather poorly. When examining the document, this section offers large walls of text that could have been further broken up to provide more clarity and structure for the reader. This is akin to adding concise but descriptive in-line comments throughout your code to improve readability. Overall, this further demonstrates the importance of standardized structure and formatting while maintaining enough detail for an onlooker to quickly grasp the concepts being presented.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are one of the most important aspects to consider when developing software. User experience and design will often be the first aspects a user sees, interacts with, and subsequently critiques. This is why it is important to ensure the user's needs and experience are considered during all stages of the design process. For the purposes of this project, the user's needs were considered when deciding which recommendations to provide on the design document. Understanding how the growth of the userbase was the client's main concern facilitated many of the recommendations to provide for a seamless interconnected cross-platform offering.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

A comprehensive cost or risk analysis would be two excellent features to incorporate in future software design processes. This is because security and maintenance are two of the most important aspects to consider when implementing code in nearly any capacity. Ensuring data integrity and protecting private data are paramount to securing servers, databases, and sensitive user information. For the purposes of this project, I approached it with a big-picture format to try and provide a comprehensive cross-platform approach to the userbase. Incorporating standups and reviews to apply kanban techniques in team settings would be great techniques to incorporate in tandem with many of the concepts covered throughout this course.
