This is a repository of my project files and final submission for my final portfolio for the CS-230 Operating Platforms Class at SNHU.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client desired to expand their already long-standing successful game to a cross-platform approach. This would faciliate the need of cross-plaform APIs
and development to take into account implementation for several differnt operating systems. This expansion from an Android-only game, Draw It or Lose It, to a cross platform web based experience will serve as the framework for ensuring connectivity across a multitude of devices. The Gaming Room as the client sought for this expansion to grow their audience while also maintaining cross-connectivity for their established members. The delivery of the product in a web-based platform will facilitate scalability, cross-platform connectivity, and allow for a seamless user experience.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
