This is a repository of my project files and final submission for my final portfolio for the CS-230 Operating Platforms Class at SNHU.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?



What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?



What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?



How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
